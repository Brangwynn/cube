        <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
        <p>As a primarily back-end coder, one of my greatest challenges was learning
            and understanding JavaScript. As such, when presented with the opportunity to
            develop a solid fandation and much deeper understanding of a variety of concepts,
            such as the creation of WebGL graphics using the canvas element, the implementation
            of buffers and shaders, and how three-dimensional objects are rendered within modern
            graphics systems (among others), I jumped at the challenge.
        </p>
        <p>    
            Within the fascinating domain of Graphics and Visualization, I encountered a rich 
            tapestry of elements that served as the foundation for grasping its intricate concepts. 
            From rendering to foundational modeling, geometric modeling to computer animation, each 
            aspect contributed to a solid foundation and fostered a deeper comprehension of the 
            complexities of graphics creation. As I began this journey, I realized that this course 
            encompassed a variety of elements that serve as the essential foundation for comprehending 
            rendering, modeling, and animation.
        </p>
        <p>For this project, I wanted to build off the assignment that I personally felt was the most 
            fun (and challenging) of the course. That was the interactive cube. I updated the code to 
            interact directly with the userâ€™s mouse instead of a slider. Then, to better show depth 
            and the Z-buffer I added a second, smaller cube behind the original one. I then changed 
            the canvas color to white and altered the actual colors of the cubes to be random each 
            time the program is loaded.
