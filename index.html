        <h2>Project Explanation</h2>
        <p>
            As someone primarily versed in back-end development, delving into JavaScript and design
            posed a formidable challenge. The opportunity to develop a robust understanding of diverse 
            programming concepts — ranging from WebGL graphics creation using the canvas element to the 
            intricacies of implementing buffers and shaders and rendering three-dimensional objects in 
            modern graphics systems — was an endeavor I eagerly embraced.
        </p>
        <p>    
            In Graphics and Visualization, I discovered a rich mosaic of components that laid the 
            groundwork for mastering its complex principles. The journey through various facets of this 
            field, from rendering and foundational modeling to geometric modeling and computer animation, 
            not only built a solid base but also deepened my understanding of the nuances involved in 
            creating sophisticated graphics. This educational path unveiled a comprehensive spectrum of 
            elements crucial for understanding rendering, modeling, and animation.

            For my project, I chose to enhance the assignment that I found most engaging and challenging - 
            the interactive cube. I refined the interaction model by enabling direct mouse control over the 
            cube, moving away from the traditional slider approach. To enhance the representation of depth 
            and demonstrate the capabilities of the Z-buffer more effectively, I introduced a second, smaller 
            cube positioned behind the original. Additionally, I modified the canvas background to black and 
            programmed the cubes to display in randomly selected colors each time the program runs, adding 
            an element of surprise and visual interest.
